The Reframing design pattern refers to changing the representation of the output of a machine learning problem. For example, we could take something that is intuitively a regression problem and instead pose it as a classification problem (and vice versa). 

The first step of building any machine learning solution is framing the problem. Is this a supervised learning problem? Or unsupervised? What are the features? If it is a supervised problem, what are the labels? What amount of error is acceptable? Of course, the answers to these questions must be considered in context with the training data, the task at hand, and the metrics for success.
