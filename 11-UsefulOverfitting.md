In a dynamic system, which for example is a set of equations governed by the laws of electromagnetic radiation - there is no unobserved variable, no noise, no statistical variability.
For a given set of inputs there is only one precisely calculable output. There is no overlap between different examples in the training dataset. For this reason we can toss out concerns about generalization. We want out ML model to fit the training data as perfectly as possible to overfit.

Overfitting is useful when
* There is no noise, so labels are accurate for all instances
* You have the complete dataset at your disposal, overfitting becomes interpolating the dataset.
