The Two-Phase Predictions design pattern provides a way to address the problem of keeping large, complex models performant when they have to be deployed on distributed devices by splitting the use cases into two phases, with only the simpler phase being carried out on the edge. 

Quanitization- Learned model weights are represented with fewer bytes.
