The Feature Cross design pattern helps models learn relationships between inputs faster by explicitly making each combination of input values a separate feature. 

A feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by concatenating two or more categorical features in order to capture the interaction between them. By joining two features in this way, it is possible to encode nonlinearity into the model, which can allow for predictive abilities beyond what each of the features would have been able to provide individually.
