The Bridged Schema design pattern provides ways to adapt the data used to train a model from its older, original data schema to newer, better data. This pattern is useful because when an input provider makes improvements to their data feed, it often takes time for enough data of the improved schema to be collected for us to adequately train a replacement model. The Bridged Schema pattern allows us to use as much of the newer data as is available, but augment it with some of the older data to improve model accuracy.
