In many classification situations, creating a neutral class can be helpful. For example, instead of training a binary classifier that outputs the probability of an event, train a three-class classifier that outputs disjoint probabilities for Yes, No, and Maybe. Disjoint here means that the classes do not overlap. A training pattern can belong to only one class, and so there is no overlap between Yes and Maybe, for example. The Maybe in this case is the neutral class.
